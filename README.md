## Welcome!
Welcome to our CS-546 Final Project, a website for people who love to read (or maybe people who just want to feel smart and pretend to love to read). If you'd like to give our site a shot, keep reading.

## How to Get Started
The first thing you'll want to do is 'git clone' this repo. Then, 'cd' into the directory, and run 'npm install' to grab all the dependencies you'll need to make everything run smoothly. Once  you've done this, you'll want to make sure you have MongoDB running on your machine. Then, you should be good to go. Run 'npm start', head to localhost:3000, and have some fun making your way through our site.

## Fun Features
You might be wondering what you can do once on our site. Well, here are some things you might want to try:
- browsing all books on the homepage
- browsing by author
- browsing by genre
- searching by title
- searching by author
- searching by genre
- searching by keyword
- adding books to your "To-Read" list
- adding books to your "Completed" list
- annotating the books on your "To-Read" list
- annotating the books on your "Completed" list

We hope you enjoy!
